# Survival Zombie 2D

The project was made for team programming classes at the university. 
As a team of beginner developers, we chose the Unity engine to create a 2D game with a zombie apocalypse theme.
60 hours scheduled for classes were intended to familiarize with the Unity engine and to provide the following features in the designed game

## Features
* Main menu with game mode selection (Options, How2Play, Single Game)
* Character selection menu with animated character preview (Nickname selection, Appearance selection)
* Available 4 characters to choose
* Craftbox panel
* Pause menu
* Random map generator using perlin noise (creating elements of the natural environment on the stage)
* Random monster generator on stage (Available 3 animals: Chicken, cow, pig with movement/idle animation)
* Ability to fight monsters
* Ability to collect/use/store in inventory dropped items from killed monsters
* Player statistics (HP / Stamina / Armor)

## Design patterns used in the project
* State machine pattern (Player character, Monsters)
* Singleton (Player Inventory)
* Factory pattern (Spawning monsters on scene)
* Humble object pattern (Used to prepare unit tests)
